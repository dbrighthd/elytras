 

Elytras+ and Textures+ Discord server: https://discord.gg/WCvwtzWThis was inspired by itembound, and I couldn't have done it without looking at it's files to see how it works

 

Uses optifine to add 150+ more elytras to your game (by renaming

the original one was going to be the full release but now I realize I am going to add a lot more.

 

Some elytras (17 of them) are created by Mojang/Minecraft, But I created the icons


 Textures by:

 - Textures+ team (dbrighthd, SwiftShadowFox, Fishysalmon)

- xshot_99

- Pride elytras by SixFootBlue (https://www.curseforge.com/members/sixfootblue/followers) 

- of course, Minecraft/Mojang for the cape Elytras
